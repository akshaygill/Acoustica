    <string name="about_msg">How best to use this app?\n\n
        Your instrument must be tuned to A440. An electronic drone which produces 
        as pure a sound as possible (with minimal overtones) has the highest likelihood to work.\n\n
        The key detection at the moment cannot deal with key modulation. For it to work, your example
        must be of one key only. The key detection only identifies major keys. Minor keys will be 
        identified as their relative minor (e.g. A minor will be detected as C major).\n\n
        Why Mozart\'s Ear?\n\n
        There is a popular story in music history about the miraculous hearing ability of the young Mozart. 
        On a visit to the Sistine Chapel, he heard some very special music. This music had never been 
        copied &#8212;there was only one written copy and the Vatican forbade people from copying in order 
        to guarantee the music would not be performed anywhere else. Mozart heard this music, music 
        the Vatican thought it had a monopoly on, and upon his return home, he wrote it all down.\n\n
        Mozart\'s Ear is meant to give you, regardless of musical training, the ability to hear 
        music like Mozart did.</string>
