Acoustica
===========

Acoustica is an android app that aims to help amateur musicians in composing music. Music composition requires extensive ear training and knowledge of music theory. Acoustica attempts to reduce this steep learning curve by assisting the user in making a transition from a melody to a complete song composition. The app also helps solo musicians by giving them access to more instruments for their composition. The scope of the app for this course was to provide backing percussion based on an input melody provided by the user.

To run the app
==============

1. Copy the Acoustica_Recordings folder to the main file directory on your phone. This should be the same directory as your Music and Picture folders.

2. Run the app.
